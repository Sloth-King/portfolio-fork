This project is being made in a team of 6, with 3 artists and 3 developers, it is undoubtedly my largest project. Being a small team, I’ve had to work on various different tasks such as gameplay development, bug fixing, refactoring, code cleaning, UI/UX, game design, marketing and communications, etc… The project is not yet released (with an expected release January 2026), so no git or playable version is available today.

[2019] describing the generation of oceans with shaders using Tiling and blending.(view “Implemented Paper” button for the source). Our work consisted of understanding and implementing this work into godot, more specifically with gdshader and glsl. Our work includes ocean generation using Linear Tiling and Blending, orientable oceans with flow maps, Lean Mapping (specular light dampening, not perfectly implemented), and many different debug tools made in godot to help complete the project.",
